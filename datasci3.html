<h2>Neural Network Modelling and Training</h2>

    <p class="DE-georgedesc"> Now we get to the fun part, creating our neurel network with a model and running it on our data! For this exercise, we
         will be using a model <br> from Tensorflow Hub called Mobilenetv2. You can read more about this model <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/method/mobilenetv2">here</a>
         This is referred to as transfer learning in AI, because we are <br> taking an  existing model and using it on our data vs writing our own, which takes time to do. There are many sites that provide models,
         <br> ModelZoo, Huggingface, and many others. To find the right model to use is about experimenting and running tests. <br>
          I have found MobilenetV2 to be consistent with images, so thats why we will be using it in our lab.</p><br>

    <p> Before diving into model training, an overview of neurel networks and deep learning would be helpful to understand
        what our model is doing during the process. <br> Neurel networks are layers of compute a model runs through for training.
         Each layer has its own model that runs on the data and outputs a accuracy score. <br> The more layers a model executes
        the more accurate it will be by mapping numbers in an array.</p>

    <p> Below is an image that shows the layers in our model mobilenetv2. Notice the first layer pattern, which consists of
        three numbers, 224, 224, 3. The first two numbers are <br> the width and height of our image, the third number represents
         the color specturmof Reg, Green, Blue, better known as RGB for our images, consisting of 3 colors.</p>
