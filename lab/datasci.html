<h2>Labelling</h2>

        Labelling is an important part of getting our data ready for training. Lets take a look at the files that
        were uploaded to the website through <br> the events form you viewed earlier. In the terminal window type or paste
        the following command <b>showdir</b></p>
</div>

<p> You should see lots of files, similar to the image below:</p> <br>
    <pre>

</pre>
    <img src="images/trainfiles.png" height="280" width="674"/> <br>

    <p>Notice the filenames? Not very descriptive sre they? This is why labelling is
    important, we need to provide a description for each file for training so the model <br>
        knows what to predict. Lets next look at our files, but this time, with labels!</p>

<p> In this lab, we did not require you to type in the dog breed when you uploaded your file. To save time, we
    have labelled the dog breed to each file uploaded <br>
    for you, and compiled them into a csv file. You can view the list of dog breeds to files uploaded below. Note, this
    is not the full list of data collected, but a sample of the <br> contents in our file</p>


<py-script>
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from pyodide.http import open_url
    url = open_url("labels.csv")
    df = pd.read_csv(url)
    pyscript.write('imagedata',df.head(12).to_html(classes="tblstyle"))

</py-script>

<p id="imagedata"></p> <br>

<p> Lets validate our labelled data to see if its accurate! Select one of the image ID names in the
    box above by highlighting and copying it. <br> Open a new tab in rhe browser and type: 33.5.6.101:30004/train/"image filename.jpg"<br>
    <br>
     For example, for image 0021f9ceb3235effd7fcde7f7538ed62 the syntax would be <b> 33.5.6.101:30004/train/0021f9ceb3235effd7fcde7f7538ed62.jpg</b></p>

        This completes the Data Engineering side of the lab. I'd like to introduce my pal on the Data Science
        team for Whitetree, hey there George?</p>

        Hey Max, yep im here to help with the data you sent over to me for model prep and training! <br>
        To get started, lets get into a jupyter notebook! This is the tool i use to look at data,
        and do model predictions! <br> Click on the button below to get into our notebook!</p>

</div>

<p> Once you have the Jupyter Notebook Tab open, come back to the lab guide to proceed with next steps</p>
