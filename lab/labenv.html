        Ok, lets take a look at our Lab environment, we use Kubernetes for our 3 tiered app, which includes a web server, PHP, and SQL.
        The Webserver is for customers to schedule and upload images to find out which breeds would be best for their
        next music venue! Our PHP handles scripts on the site, and our DB helps manage our image data collection to prep for
        AI training. Check out the diagram below to see how its setup, then you will get to take a peak at the environment,</p>

    <h3>Lab Environment Diagram</h3>
    <img src="images/Lab Diagram.png" height="578" width="800"/></p>

<p class="diadesc"> You will be accessing the environment through a terminal window to see how our Kubernetes cluster
is setup. This is a smaller environment compared to our prod site, but its enough to show how we collect data and do
training for predictions. Click on the Terminal button below, this will open a new window on your screen. Position the
terminal window so you can see this webpage along the side to follow next steps, feel free to resize the window.</p>

<form method = "POST" action = "ssh://labuser@33.5.6.100" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="submit" name="terminal" value="Open Terminal" />
</form>

<p> Once the window is open you should be logged into our Kubernetes cluster. The Terminal button is an ssh connection
to our cluster where our apps are in containers. The prompt in your terminal window should look like the image below:</p>

<h2>Exploring Kubernetes</h2>

<p> Now that your logged into the lab cluster, lets do some exploring. If you do not have experience with Kubernetes,
    dont worry! <br> I will help explain each step! In this section of the lab, lets look at namespaces, pods, and services</p>
<h3> Namespaces </h3>

<p> Namespaces are a way to organize resources in kubernetes,
    think of multiple rooms in a house, each with a door
    that can be locked. <br> Each room has items that belong to a person, who has the key.
    Namespaces are a way to seperate apps, <br> </br>networking, security in Kubernetes  for various users, and roles.</p>

<p> Type or paste the following commands in the terminal:</p>
<ul class="k8s-1">
    <li><b>kubectl get pods</li>
    <li>kubectl get pods -n whitetree</b></li>
</ul>
<p> The command <b> kubectl</b> is used to create,view, update and delete resources in Kubernetes. <br> Notice the first
    output listed no resources found in default namespace. Kubernetes includes <br> one namespace upon install called
    default, we havent created any items in this namespace, so thats why you do not see anything listed.</p>


<p> The second command, provided some output, we are running a 3 tiered app of a webserver, php and a DB. <br>
    Looking at our Diagram above, the frontend web app serves as our customer facing site where customers <br>
    can upload images. The PHP app runs scripts on our website, that communicates with the DB to keep
    track of uploads. <br> This helps our AI process related to data labelling.</p>

<p> Lets continue, type or paste the following commands in the terminal:</p>
<ul class="k8s-1">
    <li><b>kubectl get deployments -n whitetree</li>
    <li>kubectl get services -n whitetree</b></li>
</ul>

<h3> Deployments </h3>
<p> Deployments are a way to scale apps, notice we have <b> 2/2 </b> listed in the ready column for php and www. <br>
    This means there are two copies of each app running, which will automatically be load balanced. <br>
    Should we need to update our website or php scripts, we will have one copy running while the process is occuring.</p>

<h3> Services </h3>
<p> Services allow connectivity for our apps in pods (or containers) to communicate with ech other,
    the internet or other <br> resources outside of the OS, VM Kubernetes is running in. Take a look ath the output.</p>

<p> Notice the type column, there is type <b> ClusterIP</b> and <b> NodePort</b> listed. Cluster IP is for
container to container communication<br> within Kubernetes. The ports listed are the ports a container can connect
to within the cluster. The NodePort specifies the ports <br> outside apps can connect to the container, in this case
port 30004 is used on the internet to connect to this web app. <br> 30004 is used for scale, in case we have other
apps that also connect on port 80 internal to the cluster, or outbound.</p>


<h3> Deploy a webserver </h3>
<p> lets now deploy a website in Kubernetes and see if we can access it!. This site is a sample of our data ingestion<br>
    form for customers to upload images for inferencing. Its not a full production page just yet, you will get to
    test inferencing later in the lab!. <br> This deployment script will create a deployment, service for networking,
     storage for the app to run.</p>

<p> Type or paste the following command:</p>
<ul class="k8s-1">
    <li><b>kubectl apply -f wwwconfig.yaml</b></li>
</ul>
<p> You will see a few resources get deployed in the <b>lab</b> namespace. <br> This prvides seperation
    from the default and whitetree resources for testing and development.</p>

<p> Take a look at the deployment, type / paste  this command:</p>
<ul class="k8s-1">
    <li><b>kubectl get deployment -n lab</b></li>
</ul>
<p> Noiice in the output we have a deployment 1/1 called nginxweb, this is 1 of 1 container deployed<br>
    in the lab namespace.Type the command kubectl get pod -n lab. You should see 1 pod ready as part
of the deployment. <br> The name of the pod has random characters attached to assign a unique identifier to
the deployment in case more pods of the same app are added.</p>
<p> Take a look at the services, type this command:</p>
<ul class="k8s-1">
    <li><b>kubectl get services -n lab</b></li>
</ul>
<p> The service deployed is of type NodePort, this allows the app to be accessed outside the cluster! <br>
    Open a tab in a web browser and see if you can access the webpage by typing: <br>
     <b>33.5.6.101:30088 </b></b></p>
 <p> You should see the Whitetree event form for venue scheduling, file uloads, this is one
     method we use for data ingestion to train our model!</p>


<p> Take a look at the webapp config, type / paste  this command:</p>
<ul class="k8s-1">
    <li><b>kubectl get configmap -n lab</b></li>
</ul>

<p> The configmap nginxconfig is listed. So what is a configmap anyway? Configmaps are resources in Kubernetes
to configure application properties<br>  in a seperate file!. In other words, configmaps store your application non-sensitive
data that can be used across multiple containers, assuming <br> the config is compatible with the app. You may be
used to specifying app configuration inside the app on a virtual machine or in a OS <br>  like Windows, but with Kubernetes,
    we have the ability to decouple application configuration using configmaps to be applied to other similar containers!

<p> lets take a deeper look, type or paste in the command:</p>
<ul class="k8s-1">
    <li><b>clear; kubectl describe configmap -n lab</b></li>
</ul>
<p> scroll up in the terminal window to find the <b> data </b> property. Below you will see html code
    for index.html that is used to display the webpage!</p>


<div>
    <p> Lets upload a file to the events page, this time we will view the events page that is running in production.
        Open your browser and paste or type <b> http://33.5.6.101:30085/event.html </b> </p>

    <p> Once your on the page, go ahead and fill out the form. For example: <br>
        <b> Company Name: </b> My company <br>
        <b> Venue Type: </b> Partner Venue <br>
        <b> Venue Size: </b> 8,000 - 20,000 <br>
        <br>

        Click on the <b> choose file </b> button and select a file, then click on upload. Choose any image file you like in the
        directory that opens up in the dialog box</p>


    <p> Now lets check to see if your image has been uploaded, lers login to the PHPAdmin dashboard and look
        at the mysql database! Open a browser window, paste or type: <b> http://33.5.6.101:31435/index.php </b> </p>

    <p> Once logged into the PHPadmin site, you should see a menu listing called whitetree, as shown in the image below:</p>

    <img src="images/phpadmin.jpg" height="328" width="272"/>

    <p> Click on the whitetree menu item, then click on the batabase events, as shown below: </p>
    <img src="images/events.jpg" height="462" width="272"/>

    <p> Once your in the events database you should see a listing of entries from various customers in the window
        pane to the right, do you see your entry? <br> </p>
    <p> Keeping Track of each customers flename entry helps us with the labelling part of AI, now that we have a way
        to track customer information, <br> our data science team can use this data for model predictionn </p>

    <p class="DE-maxdesc">
        Great job getting to this stage in the lab, i hope you were able to complete all the steps! <br> If you want to go back and
        redo the webapp deployment, type / paste the command <b>resetweb</b> in your terminal window. <br> Otherwise lets move on
        to where our data is stored for AI, and get into Data Science!</p>
