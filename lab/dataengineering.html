        In this section we will cover what is Data Engineering and take a look at the envrionment. At White Tree, our Data Engineers
        are responsible for three key areas, they are:</p>
    </div>
<ul class="DE-agenda">

    <li>Data Mining</li>
    <li>Big Data</li>
    <li>Data Pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>
   <b>Data Mining</b> is extracting some knowledge from the data, this can be from documents, csv files
    or other structured type formats.<br><br>
    <b>Big Data</b>,  is allot of data stored in the cloud or on-prem, sometimes also known as a Data Warehouse.
    In our case, we have lots of pictures of dogs stored within our facility!<br><br>
    Finally there is <b>Data Pipeline</b>, which is the process of getting the data to a format we can
    use with different tools, techniques</p>

<p> Here is a diagram of how we store and access our data, my pal Max can provide more detail
    while i get my set ready for a upcoming show!</p>

        Thanks Luna! Hey there, I'm Max, one of the lead Data Engineers with White Tree. I'll explain a bit about how
        we are using data ingestion from our website, internet to populate our datalake so our Data Science team has
        plenty of images to run training on.  We will get into to that here real quick, but before we do,<br>
        I would like to discuss our business justification that helped fund our AI Project!</p>

    <p class="DEmaxmarket"> Lets take a look at our marketing data, Below is a chart from when we first started scheduling events, this helped us track revenue coming
        into the business and growth potential. We had a light start beginning in Q1 of 2022 when we launched, but quickly
        became popular in Europe and US with our top Talent DJ's like Luna, DJ Noble and others. By 2023 our staff of
        performers were fully booked for the entire year, and we were not able to take in any more events, our NPS (Net Promoter Score)
        quality also started to decline, due to unhqppy customers not able to get their fav DJ for their venue.</p>

        <p class="DE-maxdesc2">
            Based on our trend in 2022, 2023 we had to make a decision. Do we hire more customer support staff, or do we invest in technology like
            AI to deliver better customer experience while reducing operations cost, staff reliability issues,  We began investing in AI end of 2023,
            we had our web front end up and running with a web intake form to help customers with performer selection, scheduling.

            By Q4 of 2023 Our call volume began to drop rapidly, (see the chart) but our event scheduling increased exponentially, with customer
            NPS also increasing! With AI, we were able to provide quicker customer response, easier scheduling, and grow our venue footprint!
            This allowed us to focus on funding marketing campaigns to hire more top talent!<br>
            We now service 4 continents with local talent onboarding each month!
